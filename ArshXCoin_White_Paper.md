# ArshXCoin White Paper

**Version 1.0**  
**April 2025**  
**Developed by: Mojtaba Shafiee**

## 1. Introduction

In an increasingly digital world, the need for decentralized, transparent, and secure financial systems is more critical
than ever. While traditional systems are centralized, prone to censorship, and often opaque, blockchain technology
offers an innovative alternative.

**ArshXCoin** is a decentralized, permissionless cryptocurrency tailored for both internal and external use within our
organization. It is built using the **Proof of Work** consensus mechanism—proven and battle-tested by Bitcoin—and is
implemented entirely in **TypeScript**, offering a modern development stack and extensibility.

ArshXCoin aims to be simple, fast, and secure while preserving the core principles of decentralization and transparency.

## 2. Problem Statement

- Centralized systems create a single point of failure and are vulnerable to attacks or censorship.
- Traditional payment rails are slow, expensive, and non-transparent.
- Internal organizational transactions often depend on third-party providers, creating latency and data exposure risks.
- There is a lack of customizable blockchain networks for enterprise-level use cases.

## 3. Our Solution: ArshXCoin

ArshXCoin provides a decentralized blockchain network with its own cryptocurrency—`ARX`—that allows instant and secure
value transfers. Based on the same foundational principles as Bitcoin, it enables:

- Transparent and verifiable transactions
- Full control over the network by running independent nodes
- Energy-secured consensus via Proof of Work
- Seamless integration into organizational tools

By developing the entire system in **TypeScript**, we ensure rapid development cycles, better tooling, and easier
onboarding for developers familiar with JavaScript/TypeScript.

## 4. Technical Specifications

| Parameter             | Value / Description                |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Consensus Algorithm   | Proof of Work (SHA-256)            |
| Block Time            | 10 seconds                         |
| Block Reward          | 50 ARX (halves every 2 years)      |
| Max Supply            | 21,000,000 ARX                     |
| Every ARX             | 100000000 atoshis                  |
| Programming Language  | TypeScript (Node.js environment)   |
| Transaction Model     | UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output)  |
| Difficulty Adjustment | Every 120 blocks                   |
| Node Architecture     | Full Node, Miner Node, Wallet Node |

## 5. Node Architecture

### Full Nodes

- Maintain a full copy of the blockchain
- Validate all transactions and blocks independently
- Participate in propagating blocks and transactions across the network
- Can run on any machine with moderate resources

### Miner Nodes

- Solve computational puzzles (Proof of Work) to create new blocks
- Compete to add blocks to the chain and receive ARX as reward
- Submit new blocks to the full node network for validation

### Wallet Nodes

- Lightweight clients for end-users
- Create and broadcast signed transactions
- Interact with full nodes for blockchain data

All nodes communicate using a custom peer-to-peer protocol over WebSockets or TCP, and the codebase is modular for easy
expansion and deployment.

## 6. Mining

Like Bitcoin, ArshXCoin uses Proof of Work to secure the network. Miners compete to solve a cryptographic puzzle
(SHA-256), and the first to solve it appends a new block to the chain and receives a block reward.

Mining incentives are structured as follows:

- **Block Reward**: 50 ARX (halves every 2 years or 1 million blocks)
- **Transaction Fees**: Optional, included by senders to prioritize transactions
- **Difficulty Adjustment**: Every 120 blocks to maintain consistent block time

## 7. Use Cases

- **Internal Payments**: Salary disbursement, bonus distribution, or supplier payments within the company.
- **Corporate Wallet Integration**: Integrate ARX with internal apps for user reward systems.
- **Transparent Auditing**: Immutable record of company-related transactions.
- **Public/External Payments**: Expand the use of ARX for partner or external payment use.

## 8. Roadmap (7-Day Development Plan)

| Day | Task                                                                 |
| --- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Setup base project structure in TypeScript, peer-to-peer networking  |
| 2   | Implement block structure, SHA-256 PoW mining, difficulty adjustment |
| 3   | Develop full node: chain sync, transaction pool, block validation    |
| 4   | Implement wallet node: UTXO model, signing/verification              |
| 5   | Build miner node: mining loop, broadcast blocks                      |
| 6   | Integrate CLI + HTTP API for interaction                             |
| 7   | Testing, documentation, launch of testnet                            |

> Optional: After week one, a simple frontend wallet can be built using React or Svelte.

## 9. Tokenomics

- **Total Supply**: 21 million ARX (fixed)
- **Initial Distribution**: All ARX must be mined (no pre-mine)
- **Inflation**: Controlled via halving mechanism
- **Block Subsidy Halving**: Every 1 million blocks (~2 years)

No tokens will be pre-allocated. ArshXCoin follows a fair launch philosophy.

## 10. Conclusion

ArshXCoin is a lightweight, developer-friendly blockchain network built with modern tools and traditional principles. By
combining the proven reliability of Proof of Work with the simplicity of TypeScript, ArshXCoin opens the door to both
organizational and community-driven applications.

This project represents a step forward in accessible blockchain infrastructure tailored for real-world use, while
maintaining decentralization, immutability, and trust.
