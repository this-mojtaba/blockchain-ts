### Coding Guids:

- use decorators to define your endpints
- don't use **_any_** type at all

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.1.25. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.

## To encrypt data:

- first of all `idOnNetwork`
- then `address`
- then `publicKey`
